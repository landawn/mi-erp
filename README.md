## Architectural Assumptions for backend
The estimation is based on a standard layered architecture (Controller -> Service -> DAL) supporting a massive data schema.

* **Database Schema:** ~1,000 Tables.
* **API Surface:** ~3,000 Web Service APIs (3 per table).
* **Complexity per API:**
    * **Controller:** 1 endpoint (100 LOC).
    * **Service Layer:** 3 methods (100 LOC per method).
    * **Data Access Layer (DAL):** 10 methods (30 LOC per method).

## Code Volume Estimation (LOC) for backend

### Production Code
| Layer | Calculation Logic | Estimated LOC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Controller** | 3,000 APIs × 100 LOC | 300,000 |
| **Service** | 3,000 APIs × 3 methods × 100 LOC | 900,000 |
| **DAL** | 3,000 APIs × 10 methods × 30 LOC | 900,000 |
| **Subtotal** | | **2,100,000** |
| **Shared Libs** | 20% Overhead | + 420,000 |
| **Total Production**| | **2,520,000** |

### Test Code
* **Ratio:** 2 lines of test code per 1 line of production code.
* **Total Test LOC:** 5,040,000

##### **Grand Total Project Scope**
> **7,560,000 Lines of Code**

## Feasibility Analysis

**Question:** Is it possible for 10 developers to complete this scope in 180 days?

**Verdict:** 🔴 **CRITICAL: NOT FEASIBLE**

### The Math
To meet this deadline, the required velocity per developer is:

$$
\frac{7,560,000 \text{ LOC}}{10 \text{ Devs} \times 180 \text{ Days}} \approx \mathbf{4,200 \text{ LOC / day}}
$$

### The Reality Gap
1.  **Required Output:** 4,200 lines per day, per person.
2.  **Industry Average:** 10–50 lines of *finished, debugged* code per day for complex enterprise systems.
3.  **Discrepancy:** The plan requires a pace **80x–100x faster** than the industry standard.
4.  **Conclusion:** It is physically impossible for a developer to design, write, test, and debug 4,200 lines of logic daily. This volume is equivalent to typing ~150 pages of text every single day without stopping to think.

## Strategic Recommendations

To make the project achievable with the current team size, the following adjustments are required:

### A. Reduce Code Volume (Automation)
The current estimate assumes manual coding of repetitive CRUD operations (DAL/Service layers).
* **Solution:** Implement ORMs (Hibernate/JPA) and Code Generators.
* **Impact:** Could reduce DAL and Service boilerplate by 80-90%.

### B. Timeline Adjustment
If the 7.5M LOC scope is accurate and cannot be reduced:
* **Realism:** A 7.5M LOC project typically requires 50+ developers over 2-3 years.

### C. Buy vs. Build
Building a "world-class" ERP from scratch is high-risk. Consider building on top of existing open-source ERP kernels to skip the foundational plumbing.
